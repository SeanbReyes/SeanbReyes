# 👋 Hello, I'm Sean Reyes!

I'm mainly a **Software Developer** and current **Computer Science student** at [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) aspiring to become a Computer Scientist.
With a love for both **high-level and low-level programming**, I thrive on solving complex problems,
building scalable solutions.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

- **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, C++, C, Python, Go
- **Frontend:** React, React Native, HTML, CSS, Expo
- **Backend:** Node.js, NestJS, Express.js, Deno, Flask, Gin
- **Databases** SqLite, PostgresSql, MongoDB, Elastic Search, MySql
- **Architecture:** Microservices, Monolithic, Serverless
- **Design Patterns:** 
  - Behavioral: Saga, Observer, Strategy, Chain of Responsibility
  - Structural: Adapter, Facade, Proxy, Composite
  - Creational: Singleton, Factory, Prototype, Builder
  - Architectural: Event Sourcing, Layered Architecture, CQRS, Hexagonal
  - **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Event-Driven Design (EDD)**
- **Other Knowledge Areas:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming (FP), SOLID principles, Data Structures, Algorithms, Low-Level Programming

## 🌐 About Me

- 🎓 **Current Student**: Pursuing Computer Science at [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science).
- 💻 **Note**: Clean arch is actually a lie and let's face it, python is actually not that great.
- 📚 **Always Learning**: Currently delving deeper into low-level programming and system design.

## 🚀 Experience Highlights

- **Production-Ready Microservices**: Developed, utilizing Docker, Kubernetes, and message brokers like RabbitMQ & Kafka.
- **Design Patterns**: Experienced with a range of design patterns, including Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), and more.
- **Low-Level Knowledge**: Familiar with memory management, network protocol design, data structures, and algorithms that contribute to high-performance applications.

## 💼 Currently Working On

- Studying low-level programming concepts (Rust & C++) to deepen understanding of systems programming.
